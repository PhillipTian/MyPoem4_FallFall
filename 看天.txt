人生如果注定孤独
迎合会落于平庸
走着自己的孤独
因为你只有一条能称为路
                      ----题记 2021.11

无数贫瘠的黑夜
只是因为阳光
照在另一面
无数你向往的世界
平行地通往
不过是末日的终点

可又如何
你在寻觅着什么
春时的使者
冬夜的囚徒
当暴风雨带走一切温暖
当世界陷入
用爱情陪葬的无底黑暗
像渔人
穿过四季的幻变
拥抱前方的黑夜
像树洞里
多少心事彻夜不眠
多少伤害用死亡来翻篇

诗人赞颂黑夜
我独行在
黑夜的身边
你是黎明前最亮的火焰
你是我一生追随的晴天

没有噪点的现在永远平淡
噪点堆砌的回忆时而感叹
当你描述的未来只有噪点
我早都放下了执念和期待

晴天下的告白会被风筝听见
你说不如我在耳旁呢喃
寒风里的告白不如怀抱温暖
答应我也陪你走过声声慢

可风筝也会坠落
呢喃归于无言的平淡
青春的脚印
终于被秋天的枫叶覆盖
你倾心爱过的诗人
弄丢了属于他的句子和笔
你用力吻过的钢琴家
却再也听不见音符和旋律

你还是个孩童
一朵白云都是眼里的五彩和斑斓
它投射在需要懂事的时代
只看见了一次次不解和荒诞

你望着未来
却拘泥于过去
试着忘记过去
却没有勇气
直面每一个现在
你还在寻觅着什么
支离破碎的词
找不到合适的顺序来拼凑
你再也找不到回去的路
再也没有梦的火把
驱散前行的雾
人生不过只有一条路
这条或者那条
却没有回头路
未来是这样或者那样
却不会是你想的那样

"可在无数贫瘠的黑夜
因为有你在
就算是末日
也不过
当作至死的浪漫
"

If life is destined to be lonely
To meet will fall into mediocrity
Walk your own loneliness
Because you only have one that can be called the road
                      ---- inscription 2021.11

Countless barren dark nights
Just because the sun
Shines on the other side
Countless worlds you yearn for
Parallel to each other
But the end of the end

So what?
What are you looking for
A messenger in springtime
Prisoner of the winter night
When the storm takes away all the warmth
When the world is plunged
A bottomless darkness buried with love
Like a fisherman
Through the shifting seasons
Embracing the darkness of the night ahead
Like in a tree hole
How many hearts stay awake all night
How many hurts to turn the page with death

Poets praise the night
I walk alone in
By the side of the night
You are the brightest flame before the dawn
You are the clear sky I follow all my life

The present without noise is always dull
When you describe the future with only noise
When the future you describe is only noise
I let go of my obsessions and expectations long ago

Confessions under the sunny sky will be heard by the kite
You say it's better than me whispering in my ear
A confession in the cold wind is better than a warm embrace
Promise me to walk with you through the sound

But the kite will fall too
The murmur returns to the dullness without words
The footprints of youth
Finally covered by the autumn maple leaves
The poet you loved so much
Lost his sentences and pen
The pianist you kissed so hard
But you can no longer hear the notes and melodies

You are still a child
A white cloud is the color and splendor of your eyes
It is projected in the age of needing to know
Only to see the incomprehension and absurdity again and again

You look to the future
But you are stuck in the past
Trying to forget the past
But you don't have the courage
To face each present
You're still searching for something
Fragmented words
Can't find the right order to put it all together
You can't find your way back
No longer have the torch of a dream
To dispel the fog of moving forward
There is only one road in life
This one or that one
But there's no turning back
The future is this or that
But not the way you think

"But on countless barren dark nights
Because you are here
Even if it's the end
It's only
As a romance to death
"
