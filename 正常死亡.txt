你说
想看星星

十二岁
我会剪张纸片
贴在窗户上
牵着你
走进我的幻想

十五岁
我会为你
青涩又投入地歌唱
让所有的星星
都为我们明亮

可我已经过了
看花不是花的年纪
还没来得及
等到看花似花的春季
就只剩枯萎的叶
和十字架似的脉搏
宣判着我的酷刑
——
都不再跳动了
和这宇宙的万象

在深深的夜晚
听着你
依偎在我耳旁的呼吸
没有甜蜜
只有同样深深的
——
对于明天的恐惧

You said
Want to see the stars

Twelve years old
I can cut a piece of paper
Stick it on the window
And hold you
Into my fantasy

Fifteen years old
I will sing for you
Singing in a youthful and devoted way
Let all the stars
Will shine brightly for us

But I've already passed the age
The age of seeing flowers that are not flowers
I haven't had the time
Waiting for the spring when flowers look like flowers
Only withered leaves are left
And a cruciform pulse
Sentencing me to torture
--I'm not...
No longer beating
And all the images of the universe

In the deep night
Listening to you
Breath nestled in my ear
There is no sweetness
Only the same deep
---
The fear of tomorrow
