十分钟写了人生第一首英文打油诗...
Poem :I stand in the gale 

I met a girl
and told her my heart is on sale 
She is a princewhale ...
Though,I am miles from her ideal 

i will
tell her a fairy tale
and compliment her beautiful nail
i just love it
the day without us,still

Pill,pill
My face goes pale 
I see us laughing across the hill
I remember every moment of enjoying our meal and grill...

But Now I Iose her feeling nothing is real
Only can I appeal
for a demon deal
Girl
Why not come and make my heart heal

WELLwell
Knowing that the words 
you say boded ill
So
i will
practice my skill
and produce thrill
falling down for U again 
and Girl
      please don't call me a silly male...
