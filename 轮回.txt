我知道那最大的残酷
我知道我曾爱你
我知道
我知道我爱你
然后被自己抛弃
选择忘记
选择置若罔闻
选择逃避一切
选择忘记
选择置若罔闻
选择逃避回忆
你可以
怎样都可以
不会受到任何惩罚
最大的残酷
是你不会受到任何惩罚
我知道
我要找你
说一声对不起
趁有些事还有意义
趁我还没有被你忘记
我不能选择忘记
不能置若罔闻
不能麻木自己
不能在深夜一个人
将心碎唱给自己听
你在哪里
你在哪里
你在哪里
我想见你
然后忘记一切
然后置若罔闻
不能见你
不如抛弃自己
不如忘记一切
戴上面具继续生活
不去触碰那些心痛
然后摘下面具
失去五官

喝下十三杯啤酒
黄昏将我撕碎
痛苦和喜欢在时间里
又一次轮回


I know the greatest cruelty
I know that I loved you
I know
I know I loved you
And then abandoned by myself
Choose to forget
Choose to turn a deaf ear
Choose to run away from everything
Choose to forget
Choose to turn a deaf ear to it
Choose to avoid memories
You can
You can do whatever you want
There will be no punishment
The greatest cruelty
Is that you will not be punished in any way
I know that
I need to find you
To say I'm sorry
While some things still mean something
Before I'm forgotten by you
I can't choose to forget
I can't just ignore it
I can't numb myself
I can't be alone late at night
Singing my heartbreak to myself
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
I want to see you
And forget everything
And then ignore it
Can't see you
How about abandoning yourself
How about forgetting everything
Put on a mask and go on living
Not to touch the heartache
Then take off the mask
Lose your features

Drink 13 glasses of beer
Dusk tears me apart
Pain and love in time
Another reincarnation
