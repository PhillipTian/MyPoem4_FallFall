是古城
是旧巷
还是一如你前生的模样
我来自千里之外
一个地方
名叫故乡

云朵也会哭泣
月色令人哀伤
在多少不眠的深夜
一个声音在脑海里盘旋
所有的悲欢爱恨构成了人间
而我
属于另一个世界

是整齐的生活
是凌乱的表演
还是青石板上回荡的
诗一般的语言
是不同的剧情
却相同的离别
路的尽头
是消失的终点
还是梦的幻灭



It's the old city
Is it the old alley
Or is it the same as you were in your previous life
I come from a thousand miles away
A place
Called my hometown

Even the clouds can cry
The moon is sad
In how many sleepless nights
A voice hovers in my head
All the sorrow, joy, love and hate that make up the earth
And I
Belong to another world

It's a neat life
Is it a messy performance
Or the echoing on the green stone
Poetic language
It is a different drama
But the same parting
The end of the road
Is it the end of disappearance
Or the disillusionment of dreams
