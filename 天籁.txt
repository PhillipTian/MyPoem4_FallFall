我说不出来
我想不明白
她可在传说中的天边外
她是怎样一路走来
她的心思有谁能猜
又如何知道我的存在

风停不下来
风吹到现在
可去过人们说的天边外
风是怎样一路走来
风的方向有谁能猜
又如何让吹进我的心怀

她轻轻唱起来
宛如天籁
让我的梦似翅膀心似海
心似海身若尘埃
梦醒来
她却走开

雪飘在这舞台大地银白
看不见她的脚印留下来
心似海身如尘埃
天边外
她早已不在

我说不出来
我想不明白
谁会在传说中的天边外
你是怎样一路走来
你把过去全然忘怀
忘记了多少欢喜悲哀
她轻轻唱起来
宛若天籁

我的心汹涌澎湃身似海
我还在她却已走开
雪飘在这舞台大地银白
看不见她的脚印留下来
心似海身如尘埃
天边外她早已不在
天边外心似海
心似海身如尘埃
天边外谁的爱
最初的爱
没有被夜色掩埋

I can't say it
I can't figure it out
She can be outside the legendary sky
How she came all this way
Who can guess what she's thinking?
And how does she know I exist

The wind won't stop
The wind has blown so far
Can you go beyond the sky that people say
How did the wind come all the way
Who can guess the direction of the wind
And how to let it blow into my heart

She sings softly
Like the music of heaven
My dream is like wings and my heart is like the sea
My heart is like the sea and my body is like dust
I wake up from my dream
But she walks away

Snow drifting on the stage of the earth silver white
Can't see her footprints left behind
Her heart is like the sea and her body is like dust
Beyond the sky
She's long gone

I can't say it
I can't understand
Who will be outside the legendary sky
How did you come all this way
You have forgotten all about the past
How many joys and sorrows you have forgotten
She sang softly
Like the music of heaven

My heart is surging like the sea
I'm still here but she's gone
Snow drifting on the stage of the earth silver white
Can't see her footprints left behind
My heart is like the sea and my body is like dust
Beyond the sky she is long gone
Beyond the sky, her heart is like the sea
Heart like the sea and body like dust
Whose love is beyond the sky
The first love
Not buried by the night
