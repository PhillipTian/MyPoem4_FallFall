在莱茵的春
寻遗忘的人——找不回当初爱你的赤忱
我不见你
四月幽昏；

远走，随你达达的马蹄声
所有落地的爱恨都生了根

In the spring of the Rhine
Seeking the forgotten one - I can't find the passion of loving you at first
I don't see you
April dusk.

Far away, following the sound of your horses' hooves
All the love and hatred that have fallen to the ground have taken root
