五彩
你说那是你双眼里藏匿的浪漫
我找了好久
好久
我说
我爱你
我说
你看星星的光
25年以前出发只是为了
注定的今天
所以我吻了你

那年我也曾
这样问你
法兰的雪不舍得融化
它一直在等你的回答
那年我也曾
这样吻你
在街边的角落
今天经过了那里
只剩一盏孤单的灯

你眼里的河
淌过春天和树林
趟过冬天和丘陵
在十月的这个夜晚
流到了我的心里
你眼里的歌
惊扰了多少男孩
月光下平静的梦
但直到被我听到
你流下了感动的眼泪
你的纱裙
是多少回忆里的望眼欲穿
你的微笑
终于被车水马龙淹没了痕迹

莱茵
没有春天
莱茵
找不到那颗山楂树
你的心不属于我
我还是为你而来
如果我有天不写诗了
有件事希望你能记得


Colorful
You said it was the romance hidden in your eyes
I searched for a long time
For a long time
I said
I love you
I said
Look at the light of the stars
25 years ago I set out just for
The day that was meant to be
So I kissed you

That year I also
I asked you the same thing
Frank's snow won't melt
It's been waiting for your answer
That year I also
Kissed you like this
On the corner of the street
I passed by there today
Only a lone light remains

The river in your eyes
Flowing through spring and woods
Through winter and hills
On this October night
Flowing into my heart
The song in your eyes
Disturbed many boys
Calm dreams in the moonlight
But until I heard it
You shed tears of emotion
Your sarong
Is how many memories of looking at the eyes
Your smile
Finally the traffic drowns out the traces

Rhine
No spring
Rhine
Can't find the hawthorn tree
Your heart doesn't belong to me
I'm still here for you
If I stop writing poems one day
There is something I hope you can remember
